# permit-app

## Overview
Permit-app is an automation platform that streamlines the permit application process from
start to finish. The goal is to reduce manual data entry, track requirements, and help
teams submit complete applications faster.

## What the app will do
- Collect project and site details once and reuse them across permit forms.
- Guide users through jurisdiction-specific requirements with smart checklists.
- Auto-generate common documents and prefill application PDFs.
- Track application status, deadlines, and required follow-ups.
- Centralize communications, approvals, and file uploads in one workspace.

## Who it helps
Builders, project managers, and operations teams who handle multiple permit submissions
and want a consistent, repeatable workflow.
